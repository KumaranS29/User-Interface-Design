Visual Hierarchy:

Bad Design: Information is presented in a plain list format with no emphasis on key details. The price, title, and location blend into the text and are difficult to quickly identify.
Good Design: Uses bold, larger fonts and color to emphasize the price and title. Important information like "For sale" is clearly labeled with a distinct badge.

Alignment and Spacing:

Bad Design: Text is left-aligned and closely packed, making it harder to read. The spacing is inconsistent.
Good Design: Uses clean and consistent alignment. Spacing between elements makes the information more digestible.

Icons and Visual Cues:

Bad Design: Relies solely on text, which makes scanning slower.
Good Design: Uses intuitive icons for location, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms, making the card more visually appealing and easier to scan quickly.

Grouping and Structure:

Bad Design: Information is listed line by line without clear sections, making it harder to distinguish categories.
Good Design: Groups related information together—price and status, property details, and contact info—making it more organized.

Typography and Readability:

Bad Design: Uses the same font size and weight for most information, making it difficult to differentiate key elements.
Good Design: Varies font size, weight, and color to create contrast and focus attention on important details.

Aesthetics and Consistency:

Bad Design: The design feels flat and lacks visual balance.
Good Design: Uses rounded corners, clean lines, and better color contrast, creating a more modern and polished appearance.

User Experience (UX):

Bad Design: Provides all information without prioritization, making it overwhelming.
Good Design: Prioritizes the most important details first (price, title, location) and simplifies contact information at the bottom.
